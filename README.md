# Project--Retail-Insights-Generator-Using-Large-Language-Model-And-Embedding-Techniques
 The Retail Insight Generator represents a significant advancement in the realm of retail management
 by integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to facilitate intuitive interaction with
 inventory data. It allows store managers to ask natural language questions about their inventory stored
 in a MySQLdatabase and receive real-time answers. It aims to overcome the need for writing complex
 SQLqueries by store managers, empowering them to directly interact with their inventory data in plain
 English. The problem is to design and implement a conversational system that can understand natural
 language questions from store managers and convert them into accurate SQL queries. The system
 should then execute these queries on the MySQL database, retrieving relevant information. The system
 utilizes Google GenerativeAI, LangChain, Hugging Face LLM, Chroma DB, Tkinter technologies to
 implement it. The advantages include improved accessibility, increased efficiency, enhanced
 decision-making. The disadvantages include natural language processing models that might
 misinterpret complex questions, leading to inaccurate results, and may not support all types of
 complex data analysis tasks. Retail Insight Generator offers a promising approach to simplifying
 inventory data access and analysis for store managers. While limitations exist, the project holds
 significant potential for enhancing efficiency and empowering non-technical users in retail settings.
